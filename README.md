    -- F.A.Q. and "To Do"  -----------------------------------


         -- F.A.Q. -- 


             -- QUESTION  --  What do "Critical" and "Optional" mean inside of this code?

                 Critical = ("Program functionality is halted because of this error")

                 Optional = ("It gives a console error, but it doesn't affect the program. 
                 (It would be good practice to solve them anyway)")

             -- QUESTION -- What is this project?

                 This project is a snake game program, this project, together with the source code,
                 is open source.

                 You can feel free to complete any of the "TO DO" tasks right below to keep the code  
                 afloat, 
                 if you decide to do so, and find a solution to any of the "TO DO", feel free to start 
                 a pull request on Github, 
                 I will look your solution and see if it's ok to 
                 implement inside of the source code. (I will notice if you try to place malicious 
                 scripts. Please refrain from doing so!)

                 Even though the code is opensource. I do require attribution if featured on your 
                 channel or blog post. (or any other public thing)

                 You do NOT have the right to claim this code as your own, if featured,
                 it requires the correct attribution (look end of the code for more details
                 about copyright) 


            -- TO DO --


             If you have any suggestions, start a pull request with the edited code that
